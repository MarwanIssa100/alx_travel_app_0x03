- Can be run independently of Django server

#### `start_celery.sh` (NEW)
- Shell script for easy Celery worker startup
- Includes RabbitMQ status checking
- Proper directory validation

#### `CELERY_SETUP.md` (NEW)
- Comprehensive setup guide
- Installation instructions for RabbitMQ
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Production considerations

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Asynchronous Email Processing
- Email tasks run in background without blocking API responses
- Uses Celery's `delay()` method for non-blocking execution
- Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Email Content Generation
- HTML email templates with booking/payment details
- Plain text fallback for email clients
- Professional formatting with company branding

### 3. Task Management
- Shared tasks accessible from anywhere in the application
- Proper task registration and discovery
- Result tracking and status monitoring

### 4. Integration with Existing Code
- Minimal changes to existing view logic
- Maintains existing API functionality
- Preserves payment gateway integration

## Configuration Details

### Celery Settings
```python
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'amqp://localhost:5672//'
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'rpc://'
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_TIMEZONE = TIME_ZONE
```

### Email Settings
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = env('EMAIL_HOST_USER', default='your-email@gmail.com')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = env('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD', default='your-app-password')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Manual Task Execution
```python
from listings.tasks import send_booking_confirmation_email

# Trigger email task
result = send_booking_confirmation_email.delay(booking_id)
```

### 2. API Integration
- Create booking via `POST /api/bookings/`
- Email automatically triggered in background
- API response returns immediately

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Test Celery connection
python manage.py test_celery

# Test email functionality
python manage.py test_celery --create-test-booking
```

## Dependencies
All required packages are already included in `requirement.txt`:
- `celery==5.5.3`
- `amqp==5.3.1`
- `kombu==5.5.4`
- `billiard==4.2.1`

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Email Service**: Replace Gmail SMTP with dedicated email service
2. **Result Backend**: Use Redis instead of RPC for better performance
3. **Monitoring**: Implement Celery Flower for web-based monitoring
4. **Process Management**: Use Supervisor for production process management
5. **Security**: Configure RabbitMQ authentication and SSL
6. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for production debugging
